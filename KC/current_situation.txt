As a refresher, the definition of Climate change is "a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earthâ€™s local, regional and global climates" according to [NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/resources/global-warming-vs-climate-change/). Global warming is a big part of climate change, and is caused by higher-than-normal amounts of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere.

In the past 30 years, world greenhouse gas emissions have increased by nearly 45% at a rate higher than ever before. In fact, according to (NASA)[https://climate.nasa.gov], carbon dioxide, the largest contributor, is at its highest concentration in the air in 650,000 years! These high levels of Carbon dioxide come mainly from human activities (such as burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and livestock farming) and thus fuel the global warming crisis leading to drastic climate changes across the globe such as increasing temperatures and melting ice caps.

With increasing temperatures, the summers are increasingly hot and we use more electricity through fans and air conditioning to keep cool. However, this in turn also releases more carbon emissions into the atmosphere further contributing to global warming and perpetuating this vicious cycle of climate change.
